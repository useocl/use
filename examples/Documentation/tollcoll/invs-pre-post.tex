Invariants
----------

context Truck inv numIsKey  - num is key attribute for Truck
context Point inv nameIsKey - name is key attribute for Point
context Point inv noCycles  - no cycles in the Point graph

Pre- and postconditions for Point operations
--------------------------------------------

context Point::init(aName:String)
pre  freshPoint   - Point is unused
post nameAssigned - attribute name was assigned
post allPointInvs - all Point invariants hold

context Point::northConnect(aNorth:Point)
pre  aNorthDefined      - param aNorth not undefined
pre  freshConnection    - planned link not in self's north/south links
pre  notSelfLink        - planeed link not a self loop
pre  insertionOk        - planned link induces not a cycle
post connectionAssigned - planned link existing
post allPointInvs       - all Point invariants hold

context Point::southConnect(aSouth:Point)
- analogously to northConnect

Pre- and postconditions for Truck operations
--------------------------------------------

context Truck::init(aNum:String)
pre  freshTruck           - Truck is unused
post numTripsDebtAssigned - Truck attributes were assigned
post allTruckInvs         - all Truck invariants hold

context Truck::enter(entry:Point)
pre  tripsOk         - trips empty or last is undefined
pre  currentEmpty    - not currently connected to a Point
post debtAssigned    - attribute debt initialized
post currentAssigned - currently connected to entry
post allTruckInvs    - all Truck invariants hold

context Truck::move(target:Point)
pre  currentExists   - currently connected to a Point
pre  targetReachable - target connected to current Point
post currentAssigned - currently connected to target
post allTruckInvs    - all Truck invariants hold

context Truck::pay(amount:Integer)
pre  amountPositive - amount is positive
pre  currentExists  - currently connected to a Point
post debtReduced    - debt was reduced by amount
post allTruckInvs   - all Truck invariants hold

context Truck::bye():Integer
pre  currentExists           - currently connected to a Point
pre  noDebt                  - no debt due
post returnEqualsOverPayment - overpayment is returned to Truck
post currentEmpty            - not currently connected to a Point
post allTruckInvs            - all Truck invariants hold
