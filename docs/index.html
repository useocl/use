    <h2>Dashboard Overview</h2>
    <p>This dashboard provides detailed insights into the software quality metrics of the USE project.
      The diagrams below highlight key aspects of the structure of the codebase and its evolution over time.
      The metrics represent this branch only, no other branches are taken into consideration.
      The goal of this dashboard is to encourage developers to pay attention to how their changes impact architecture
      and to eventually guide them to adopt an evolutionary architecture approach according to <a href="https://evolutionaryarchitecture.com/index.html" target="_blank">Neal Ford et.al.</a></p>

        of 55 cycles without tests is recommended to at least not erode the architecture further.

  <!-- Additional Information Section -->

    <h2>Detailed Test Reports</h2>
    <p>The metrics displayed above help in understanding the architectural health of the system. However,
    they might not be enough to fully understand where the problems stem from. The output of the failure
    reports tends to be very verbose. That's why they are linked here (if they exist) as .txt-files.</p>
    <p>For a detailed test report of the cyclic dependencies in the entire use-core without tests, refer to
      <a href="archunit-results/cycles-current-failure-report.txt" target="_blank">Cycles Test Report</a>.
      Please note that detailed test reports for the individual packages are not available. If you wish to
      generate them, execute the MavenCyclicDependenciesCoreTest locally and you will find them in the
      target folder.
    </p>
    <p>For a detailed test report of the layer violations without tests, refer to
      <a href="archunit-results/layers-current-failure-report.txt" target="_blank">Layer Violations Report</a>.
      Please note that this file (like other test reports) is only available if a layer violation exists.
