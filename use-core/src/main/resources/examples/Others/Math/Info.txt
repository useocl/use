This example contains only one class with an operation
not free from side effects with return type Integer.
Its not defined as query, but with a postcondition
and result inside the class definition (not as an
explicit constraint).
The operation computes the greatest common divisor
of the arguments (two Integers). 

Math.use:
one class Math with an operation gcd

Math.cmd:
gdc is called with different arguments
the result values satisfy the postcondition
