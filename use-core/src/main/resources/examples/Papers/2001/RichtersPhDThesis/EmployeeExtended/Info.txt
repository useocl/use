This example corresponds to
the case study of Mark Richters in his PhD Thesis:
"A Precise Approach to Validating UML Models and OCL
Constraints"

EmployeeExtended.use:
Classes from /Others/Ex/Ex.use
Person renamed into Employee
Employee extended by attribute age : Integer
Employee extended by operation raiseSalary from
/Documentation/Employee.use
Invariants from /Others/Ex/Ex.use
Constraint for raiseSalary from Employee, extended
by the postcondition amount > 0 and changed
from rate to amount

EmployeeExtended.cmd:
==EmployeeExtended0.cmd,EmployeeExtended1.cmd,
EmployeeExtended2.cmd,EmployeeExtended3.cmd,
EmployeeExtended4.cmd,EmployeeExtendedRaiseSalary.cmd

Builds up on /Others/Ex/Ex.cmd and is extended
by an operation call from /Documentation/Employee.cmd
