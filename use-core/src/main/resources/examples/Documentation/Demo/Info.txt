An example with employees working in different departments
on projects, which are controlled by a department.
After executing Demo.cmd one invariant evaluates to false
because one project has a higher budged than its department.

This example is part of the "USE Quick Tour".

Demo.use:
three classes Employee, Department and Project
three associations
at least one invariant for each class

Demo.cmd:
== the sequence of Demo0.cmd to Demo4.cmd

SplitCommands/Demo0.cmd:
creates one object of type Department

SplitCommands/Demo1.cmd:
assigns the attribute values in the new object

SplitCommands/Demo2.cmd:
creates two objects of type Employee and assigns
attribute values

SplitCommands/Demo3.cmd:
creates two links between the department and the employees

SplitCommands/Demo4.cmd:
creates two projects, assigns attribute values and
creates two links between the projects and the 
department
creates links between the employees and the new projects
