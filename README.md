# USE - UML-based Specification Environment

(Note that this is a release of a research prototype. There is no
warranty of any kind.)

## Overview

USE is a system for the specification of information systems. It is
based on a subset of the Unified Modeling Language (UML) [1]. A USE
specification contains a textual description of a model using features
found in UML class diagrams (classes, associations, etc.). Expressions
written in the Object Constraint Language (OCL) are used to specify
additional integrity constraints on the model. A model can be animated
to validate the specification against non-formal requirements. System
states (snapshots of a running system) can be created and manipulated
during an animation. For each snapshot the OCL constraints are
automatically checked. Information about a system state is given by
graphical views.  OCL expressions can be entered and evaluated to
query detailed information about a system state.

The USE specification language is based on UML and OCL. Due to the
semi-formal definition of OCL there are some language constructs whose
interpretation is ambiguous or unclear [2]. In [3] and [4] we have
presented a formalization of OCL which attempts to provide a solution
for most of the problems. The USE approach to validation is described
in [5] and [6].

## Installation

To install USE, read the instructions in the [INSTALL](INSTALL) file.

## Getting started

After successful installation, the following command can be used to
invoke USE on an example specification. Change the current directory
to the top level directory of the distribution and enter the following
(the exact commands may depend on your platform):

```bash
cd examples
../bin/use -v Documentation/Demo/Demo.use
```

The command above starts USE in its default Swing UI.
To start the JavaFX UI instead, add the -jfx Parameter before all other USE options

```bash
../bin/use -jfx -v Documentation/Demo/Demo.use
```

The last command will compile and check the file Demo.use in the
examples directory. It contains a USE specification for a simple model
of a company. The -v switch is used to increase verbosity of
output. The main interface to the tool is a command line interface
where you enter commands at a prompt. The output should therefore be
similar to the following.

```
loading properties from: C:\Dev\USE\use-6.0.0\etc\use.properties
USE version X.X.X, Copyright (C) 1999-2024 University of Bremen & University of Applied Sciences Hamburg

Enter `help' for a list of available commands.
Enter `plugins' for a list of available plugin commands.
use>
```

At this point you can enter commands at the prompt (try `help' for a
list of available commands). You can enter OCL-like expressions by
starting the input with a question mark. The expression will be
evaluated and its result will be shown, e.g.:

```ocl
use> ? Set{1,2,3}->select(e | e > 1)
-> Set{2,3} : Set(Integer)
```

The file test/queries.cmd contains a large number of examples for
valid expressions.

Commands can also be read from a separate file with the "read"
command. Look at the files Demo*.cmd in the same directory. For
example, starting with Demo0.cmd, an object is created and the new
system state will be visualized in the system state window.

```use
use> open Demo0.cmd
Demo0.cmd> !create d0:Department;
```

For more information about the graphical user interface please refer
to the [quick tour](http://www.db.informatik.uni-bremen.de/projects/USE/).

## Documentation

Documentation is available in the [manual](manual/main.md) directory.
It contains a quick tour demonstrating the central features of USE.
The tool is heavily based on ideas published in [3], [4] and [6].
See the references at the end of the file.

Some information about issues related to OCL can be found in the file
README.OCL.

Note, that the documentation was automatically translated from LaTex to Markdown 
and has still many issues. Feel free to submit changes to the documentation.

## Contact

Comments and bug reports are welcome and should be addressed on [GitHub](https://github.com/useocl/use/issues).

The project's web site is <https://github.com/useocl/use/>

## Credits

The parser for USE specifications is implemented with the ANTLR parser
generator which is in the public domain. We have included the source
code of ANTLR in this distribution, so that the USE parser can be
easily regenerated. We would like to thank Terence Parr and the other
developers of [ANTLR](http://www.antlr.org) for making this great tool freely available.

## Copying

USE is released under the GNU public license, see the file COPYING for
details. The distribution contains the following libraries from
external parties. Source code for these libraries is available from
the web.

- The [ANTLR parser generator tool](http://www.antlr.org)
- The [JUnit library](http://www.junit.org)

## Reporting bugs

Bug reports can submitted on [GitHub](https://github.com/useocl/use/issues)

When submitting bug reports, use the available bug template and always include:

- a complete description of the problem encountered
- the output of `use -V'
- the operating system and version
- the architecture.

If possible, include:

- a stack trace, if an exception occurred

These steps will help diagnose the problem.
