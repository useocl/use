<center><h1>USE Quick Tour</h1></center>

<p>This quick tour will demonstrate the main features of USE.</p>

<!-- ====================================== -->

<h2>1. Example Model</h2>

<p>Consider the following UML class diagram for a simple model
describing employees, departments, projects, and their relationships
to each other.</p>

<center><img src="gen-img/cls-EDP.png" alt="class diagram"></center>

<p>We extend the model by the following four constraints which place
further restrictions on systems conforming to the model. The
constraints are first given in natural language and will later be
expressed more formally in OCL (Object Constraint Language).</p>

<p>Constraints:</p>
<ol>
<li><cite>The number of employees working in a department must be greater or
equal to the number of projects controlled by the
department.</cite></li>

<li><cite>Employees get a higher salary when they work on more
projects.</cite></li>

<li><cite>The budget of a project must not exceed the budget of the
controlling department.</cite></li>

<li><cite>Employees working on a project must also work in the
controlling department.</cite></li>
</ol>

<p>The goal of applying the USE tool is to interactively validate the
above model and the constraints. Objects and links can be created
which constitute a system state reflecting a snapshot of a running
system. In every system state, the constraints are automatically
checked for validity.</p>

<!-- ====================================== -->

<h2>2. USE Specifications</h2>

<p>The USE tool expects as input a textual description of a model and
its constraints. The above class diagram must therefore be first
translated into a USE specification (a possible extension to USE would
be the import of an XMI file created by a CASE tool like <a
href="http://argouml.tigris.org">Argo UML</a> or Rational Rose.). The
first part of the specification shown below describes the structural
information of the class diagram.</p>

<blockquote><table summary=""  width="90%" bgcolor="#e0e0e0"><tr><td><pre>
#include "Demo1.use.html"
</pre></td></tr></table></blockquote>

<p>In the second part of the specification, we define the constraints
in OCL. Each constraint is defined as an invariant in context of a
class.</p>

<blockquote><table summary=""  width="90%" bgcolor="#e0e0e0"><tr><td><pre>
#include "Demo2.use.html"
</pre></td></tr></table></blockquote>

<p>The complete specification is also available in the file <a
href="Demo.use"><tt>Demo.use</tt></a> in the example directory of the
distribution.</p>

<!-- ====================================== -->

<h2>3. Running USE</h2>

<p>The following command can be used to invoke USE on the example
specification (assuming the current working directory is the top-level
directory of the distribution and the <code>bin</code> directory is
added to your <code>PATH</code> environment variable).</p>

<blockquote><table summary=""  width="90%" bgcolor="#e0e0e0"><tr><td><pre>
<b>use examples/Demo.use</b>
</pre></td></tr></table></blockquote>

<p>This command will compile and check the file
<tt>Demo.use</tt>. There are currently two kinds of user interfaces
which can be used simultaneously. The first one is a command line
interface where you enter commands at a prompt. The output should be
similar to the following.</p>

<blockquote><table summary=""  width="90%" bgcolor="#e0e0e0"><tr><td><pre>
loading properties from: /home/mr/use/etc/use.properties
use version @release_version@, Copyright (C) 1999,2000 Mark Richters
compiling specification...
Model Company (3 classes, 3 associations, 4 invariants, 0 operations)
Enter `help' for a list of available commands.
use> 
</pre></td></tr></table></blockquote>

<p>At this point you can enter commands at the prompt (try 'help' for
a list of available commands). For example, you can enter OCL
expressions by starting the input with a question mark. The expression
will be evaluated and its result will be shown, e.g.:</p>

<blockquote><table summary=""  width="90%" bgcolor="#e0e0e0"><tr><td><pre>
use> <b>? Set{1,2,3}->select(e | e &gt; 1)</b>
-> Set{2,3} : Set(Integer)
</pre></td></tr></table></blockquote>

<p>The command line interface is useful for experienced users and for
automated validation procedures since commands can be read from a
script file. The graphical user interface is easier to learn and
provides different ways of visualizing a system state. By default both
interfaces are launched (unless you specify the switch
<code>-nogui</code> at startup time).</p>

<!-- ====================================== -->

<h2>4. The Graphical User Interface</h2>

<p>Let's get back to the example. The window that appears after
starting USE can be seen in the following screen shot (click on the
picture to get an enlarged version).</p>

<blockquote>
<a href="qt1.png"><img src="gen-img/qt1-small.png" alt="screenshot"></a>
</blockquote>

<p>On the left is a tree view showing the contents (classes,
associations, invariants, and pre- and postconditions) of the
model. The next picture shows the expanded tree with all model
elements. One of the invariants is selected and its definition is
shown in the panel below the tree.</p>

<blockquote>
<a href="qt2.png"><img src="gen-img/qt2-small.png" alt="screenshot"></a>
</blockquote>

<p>The large area on the right is a workspace where you can open views
visualizing different aspects of a system. Views can be created any
time by choosing an entry from the view menu or directly by a toolbar
button. There is no limit on active views. The next screen shot
displays the main window after the creation of four views.</p>

<blockquote>
<a href="qt3.png"><img src="gen-img/qt3-small.png" alt="screenshot"></a>
</blockquote>

<p>The two upper views list the names of classes and associations
defined in the model and shows the number of objects and links in the
current system state. The initial system state is empty, i.e., there
are no objects and links yet. The view at the lower left displays a
list of OCL invariants and their results. As you can see, all
invariants are true in the empty system state. Finally, the lower
right view will show an object diagram once we have created objects
and links. </p>

<!-- ====================================== -->

<h2>5. Creating Objects and Setting Attributes</h2>

Objects can be created by selecting a class and specifying a name for
the object. The menu command <code>State|Create object</code> opens a
dialog where this information can be entered.

<blockquote>
<a href="qt4.png"><img src="gen-img/qt4-small.png" alt="screenshot"></a>
</blockquote>

<p>Alternatively, the following command can be used at the prompt to
achieve the same effect.</p>

<blockquote><table summary=""  width="90%" bgcolor="#e0e0e0"><tr><td><pre>
use> <b>!create cs:Department</b>
</pre></td></tr></table></blockquote>

<p>And, even simpler, an object can be created via drag &amp;
drop. Just select a class in the model browser and drag it to the
object diagram.</p>

<p>Note the change in the system state views. The upper right view
indicates that there is now one department object, and the object
diagram shows this object graphically.</p>

<blockquote>
<a href="qt4a.png"><img src="gen-img/qt4a-small.png" alt="screenshot"></a>
</blockquote>

<p>A context menu available on a right mouse click in the object
diagram provides several display options. For example, the automatic
layout can be turned off, the layout of the diagram can be saved and
restored from a file, etc. In the previous picture we have turned on
the display of attribute values. You can see that the attribute values
of the department object are all undefined. For changing attribute
values, we can use the <tt>set</tt> command:</p>

<blockquote><table summary=""  width="90%" bgcolor="#e0e0e0"><tr><td><pre>
use> <b>!set cs.name := 'Computer Science'</b>
use> <b>!set cs.location := 'Bremen'</b>
use> <b>!set cs.budget := 10000</b>
</pre></td></tr></table></blockquote>

<p>Attributes can also be changed with an <em>object properties
view</em>. If you choose <code>View|Create|Object Properties</code>
from the View menu and select the <code>cs</code> object, you get the
following view where you can inspect and change attributes of the
selected object:</p>

<blockquote>
<img src="qt2c.png" alt="screenshot">
</blockquote>

<p>We continue by adding two employee objects and setting their
attributes (Again, we use the command line interface here, but the
same can be achieved by using the previously discussed steps in the
graphical user interface).</p>

<blockquote><table summary=""  width="90%" bgcolor="#e0e0e0"><tr><td><pre>
use> <b>!create john : Employee</b>
use> <b>!set john.name := 'John'</b>
use> <b>!set john.salary := 4000</b>
use> <b>!create frank : Employee</b>
use> <b>!set frank.name := 'Frank'</b>
use> <b>!set frank.salary := 4500</b>
</pre></td></tr></table></blockquote>

<p>Now we have three objects, a department and two employees, but
still no connections between them. The layout in the object diagram is
continuously refined and updated. This can be turned off by
deselecting the option <code>Auto-Layout</code> in the context menu of
the object diagram.</p>

<p>The previous commands resulted in an invalid system state. This is
discussed in detail in the next section.</p>

<blockquote>
<a href="qt5.png"><img src="gen-img/qt5-small.png" alt="screenshot"></a>
</blockquote>

<!-- ====================================== -->

<h2>6. Model Inherent Constraints</h2>

<p>The invariant view indicates some problem with the new system
state. The message says: <em>Model inherent constraints
violated</em>. Model inherent constraints are constraints defined
implicitly by a UML model (in contrast to explicit OCL
constraints). The details about this message are shown in the Log
panel at the bottom of the screen (they are also available by issuing
a <tt>check</tt> command at the prompt):</p>

<blockquote><table summary=""  width="90%" bgcolor="#e0e0e0"><tr><td><pre>
use> <b>check</b>
Multiplicity constraint violation in association `WorksIn´:
  Object `frank´ is connected to 0 object(s) of class `Department´
  but the multiplicity is specified as `1..*'.
Multiplicity constraint violation in association `WorksIn´:
  Object `john´ is connected to 0 object(s) of class `Department´
  but the multiplicity is specified as `1..*'.
</pre></td></tr></table></blockquote>

<p>The problem here is that we have specified in the model that each
employee has to be related to at least one department object (see the
class diagram above). In our current state, no employee has a link to
a department. In order to fix this, we insert the missing links into
the WorksIn association:</p>

<blockquote><table summary=""  width="90%" bgcolor="#e0e0e0"><tr><td><pre>
use> <b>!insert (john,cs) into WorksIn</b>
use> <b>!insert (frank,cs) into WorksIn</b>
</pre></td></tr></table></blockquote>

<p>Links can also be inserted by selecting the objects to be connected
in the object diagram and choosing the <code>insert</code> command
from the context menu.</p>

<p>The new state shows the links in the object diagram as red edges
between the employee objects and the department object. The invariants
are satisfied again.</p>

<blockquote>
<a href="qt6.png"><img src="gen-img/qt6-small.png" alt="screenshot"></a>
</blockquote>

<!-- ====================================== -->

<h2>7. Checking OCL Invariants</h2>

<p>We have seen that class invariants are checked automatically each
time a system state changes. This section shows how invariants can be
analyzed. We continue the example by adding two projects and linking
them to the existing employees and the department:</p>

<blockquote><table summary=""  width="90%" bgcolor="#e0e0e0"><tr><td><pre>
use> <b>!create research : Project</b>
use> <b>!set research.name := 'Research'</b>
use> <b>!set research.budget := 12000</b>
use> 
use> <b>!create teaching : Project</b>
use> <b>!set teaching.name := 'Validating UML'</b>
use> <b>!set teaching.budget := 3000</b>
use> 
use> <b>!insert (cs,research) into Controls</b>
use> <b>!insert (cs,teaching) into Controls</b>
use> 
use> <b>!insert (frank,research) into WorksOn</b>
use> <b>!insert (frank,teaching) into WorksOn</b>
use> <b>!insert (john,research) into WorksOn</b>
</pre></td></tr></table></blockquote>


<p>The resulting state is shown below.</p>

<blockquote>
<a href="qt7.png"><img src="gen-img/qt7-small.png" alt="screenshot"></a>
</blockquote>

<p>In this state, three of the four invariants are true but one
fails. The failing one has the name
<tt>BudgetWithinDepartmentBudget</tt>. This invariant states that
<cite>The budget of a project must not exceed the budget of the
controlling department</cite>. Obviously, one of the two projects in
our example must have a budget higher than the budget of the
department.</p>

<p>The value <tt>false</tt> finally resulting from an evaluation of an
invariant is not very helpful in finding the reason for an illegal
system state. An <i>evaluation browser</i> provides a more detailed
view of an expression by showing the results of all
sub-expressions. Double-clicking on an invariant will open an
evaluation browser:</p>

<blockquote>
<a href="qt8.png"><img src="gen-img/qt8-small.png" alt="screenshot"></a>
</blockquote>

<p>The root node in the evaluation browser shows the complete
expression and its result (which is false for the chosen
invariant). For each component of an expression there are child nodes
displaying the sub-expressions and their results. You can see that the
argument expression of the forAll quantifier is false, thus making the
whole expression result false. In this sub-expression, the variable
<tt>self</tt> is bound to the object <tt>research</tt>. The evaluation
browser has helped to find out that it is the budget attribute value
of this object which causes the invariant to fail.</p>

<!-- ====================================== -->

<h2>8. Evaluating OCL Expressions</h2>

<p>The OCL parser and interpreter of USE allows the evaluation of
arbitrary OCL expressions. The menu item <code>State|Evaluate OCL
expression</code> opens a dialog where expressions can be entered and
evaluated.</p>

<blockquote>
<img src="qt9a.png" alt="screenshot">
</blockquote>

The following example shows a complex expression navigating from a
department over projects to employees. The expression finds all
projects of the computer science department in which an employee
called john is involved.
